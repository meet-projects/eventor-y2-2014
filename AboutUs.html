				EVENTOR was built during the crisis that hit upon our state during Summer 2014. As a result of the 					catastrophic situation, various businesses, small companies and individual workers have found themselves in 					financial crisises. In order to aid those who have been affected by the situation, many events have been 					hosted and we saw there was much will to help.
				We wanted to create a platform for individuals like these, in which they would be able to create, share and 					host events that aim to help those in need. We hope our website assists hosts to create events for those 					affected in future times of crisis.
				<br><br>
				Our team consists of 5 members, from both Israeli and Palestinian nationalities; Omar Nashef, Eli Brown, Ophir 					Edelstein, Leen Ali and Shir Somech. We are MEET Y2 students living in Jerusalem, and are between the ages of 					15-17.
